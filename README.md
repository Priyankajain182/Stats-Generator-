# Design-Archive

This Design Archive project is developed by a student team of JNEC for VATAN TEXTILES under GIZ powered industry-academia connect programme.
## Motivation
We as a team developed a keen interest in making things work using web. So, to learn things in better way the best thing is to get your hands dirty in the dev. 
<br>
After conducting some discussion sessions with industry we curated a list of issues faced by them due to manual working. And so, we decided to deliver them a handy and simple desktop software.

## Build status
